# Python TA Reporters TODOs

## `ColorReporter`

* Come up with a better solution than highlighting the whole error line for messages without `node` attributes:

    * `line-too-long`
    * `bad-whitespace`
    * `trailing-newlines`

* Consider a special code-snippet and highlight strategy for unusual messages such as:

    * `always-returning-in-a-loop`
    * `too-many-nested-blocks`

* The triple-nested functions for `print_messages` might be overkill - consider turning `add_line` into a regular method.
